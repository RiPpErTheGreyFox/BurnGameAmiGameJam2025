Burn for the Amiga!
AmiGameJam2025

Written in 68k assembly this is my first game for the Amiga platform not using
BlitzBasic or some other tool, so some wonkiness is to be expected

A side scrolling game inspired by the likes of Commander Keen, walk to the
right, shoot fire demons, don't die

Requirements:
Tested on an OCS A500 with 512kb of Chipmem running Workbench 1.3
Approximately 320000 bytes free are required for the game to run

Also tested on an A500 running AmigaOS 3.2.2 and there were some stability
issues so YMMV

Controls:
Q - quit game
Joysticks are required to play, player 1 should be using a standard joystick
connected to port 2, if playing with two players, the mouse is not supported
